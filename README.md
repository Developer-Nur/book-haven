+ Banner Section: A prominent banner section is displayed on the website, featuring a title and a "View The List" button on the left side to guide users.

+ Navbar: A prominent navbar is positioned at the top of each page for easy navigation.

+ Book Details Page: Each book card redirects users to the Book Details page, providing comprehensive information about the selected book.

+ Reading List and Wishlist: Users can save books to their reading list and wishlist. If a book is added to the reading list, it cannot be added to the wishlist, ensuring clear categorization.
